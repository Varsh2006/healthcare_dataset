This dashboard provides an interactive platform for analyzing healthcare data. It allows users to select various analysis types and input parameters to visualize healthcare data.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:
   Clone the repository to your local machine.
   Place the healthcare_dataset.csv file in the appropriate directory.
    Run the Streamlit app using the following command:
        - streamlit run analysis.py



## Data Cleaning

 - Load the healthcare dataset.
 - Display initial data and information about the dataframe.
 - Handle missing values.
 - Correct data types of columns.
 - Display the cleaned dataframe.
 - Save the cleaned data to a CSV file.

## File Handling

The code reads the dataset from a CSV file named `healthcare_dataset.csv` and saves the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file named `clean_healthcare_dataset.csv`.

# Exception Handling
 - File not found error.
 - Empty data error.
 - Parsing error.
 - General exception handling.

# Data Visualization
Display bar chart, line chart, scatter chart, pie chart, and horizontal bar chart for selected columns.


# Dashboard
Interactive dashboard for visualizing distributions of Age, Gender, Blood Type, Medical Condition, Medication, and Test Results.

# Analysis
